# Chess

# This was created for university purpose
# The fen.java file was provided and was not edited. 

# NOTICE
# This is a simplified version of chess. To win the game, a player only needs to capture the other player's king. The concept of check and checkmate does not exist yet. Additionally, en passant and castling movements are not available yet. These were the guidelines for the project provided to us to make this class project completeable in a shorter amount of time.

# This program creates a 2 player game of chess using an array of matrices and Unicode characters to display the characters. The Forsyth-Edwards notation is used to add the initial pieces to the board. 

# How to compile and run: 
# Navigate to the folder where the project is stored using terminal cd commands. Enter "javac Game.java" java into the terminal. Enter "java Game" into the terminal.

# How to Use
# When the Game.java file is run, the game will start. White will always go first. To move your piece, enter the starting and ending matrix row/column for our move separated by spaces (Example entry: 1 1 3 1)
# When a pawn reaches the other side, the user will automatically be prompted to upgrade their pawn to a higher-level piece. To do this, enter the letter first letter of the new piece you want.

# Future Implementation
# I hope to add a few more features to this program such as check/check-mate, en passant, and castling in the future.
